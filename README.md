# R_Brew
Helper function for R developers for scraping all libraries list from the R files and install them automatically. 

Execute the main script file in the root directory and it will scrape all librares inside the directory, look for the packages needed for the project and installed the missing packages. 

This is based on the heuristics. I'm also working on the artificial intelligence and natural language based more clever approach to solve this task.
